Overview
========
In this test you will be creating a basic HTTP service with a JSON API.
The service you will build is a fly registry and it will support the following requests:

 - `GET /flys` - List all flys
 - `POST /flys` - Add a new fly
 - `GET /flys/{id}` - Get details on a specific fly
 - `DELETE /flys/{id}` - Delete a fly by id

No update method is required.

Purpose
=======

The purpose of this implements a basic API with a NoSQL database.

Requirements
============

 - You should use MongoDB as your database. We expect to find it on the
 default port `27017`
 - Write this in the language you feel most comfortable with
 - Any web framework is accepted
 - Document how to build and run your application
 - Document how to run the test suite
